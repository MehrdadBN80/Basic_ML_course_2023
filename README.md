# Machine Learning Course Materials

## Computer Science Faculty of Shahid Beheshti University
**Winter 2023**

### Description
This repository contains materials for the Machine Learning Course offered by the Computer Science Faculty of Shahid Beheshti University in Winter 2023. The course covers a range of machine learning concepts including regression, regularization techniques, gradient descent, model evaluation, and feature selection. Students will engage in both theoretical analysis and practical implementation using Python and the Scikit-learn library, supplemented with custom algorithms developed from scratch.
